    "abstract": "JavaScript is the base for many other languages; if you know JavaScript, you can work with a lot of other languages and dependent frameworks easily. This course is based on the newer features that were released with the ECMAScript specification 6 and above. So, we will only discuss things from ES6 and above. In the first section of this course, you will touch base on JavaScript history, and you will get in place all the required stuff that you should have in your machine for this course. In the second section of the course, you will focus on variables and scope, and you will see the newer patterns to work with variables. Following that, in the third section, we will discuss functions and arguments, which is a critical part of this course because JavaScript treats functions as a first-class citizens, so knowing what changes have been incorporated into them in newer versions is also very essential. In the fourth section, you will learn about operators and how to better use and code them. Then you will understand the new functionality of error handling; in an application where errors are not handled properly, the usability of such an application is nearly impossible. Then we have a section dedicated to async patterns and promises where you will see a few of the latest functions in comparison with similar older functions. By the end of the course, you will get to know the hacks and tricks to improve your coding skills. What You Will Learn Learn various JavaScript hacks Learn various JavaScript concepts Understand the spread operators in JavaScript Explore optional chaining operators Explain prototypal chains Understand error handling in JavaScript Audience This course can be taken by any advanced and intermediate JavaScript learners.
