Please, take the action to cancel the loans of this user so that data can be successfully anonymized.

Patron details in the backoffice area: <{{ spa_routes.HOST }}{{ spa_routes.PATHS['patron'] }}/{{ patron.pid }}>

  * "{{ loan.document.title }}" - start date: {{ loan.start_date }} - end date: {{ loan.end_date }} - loan PID: {{ loan.pid }} - <{{ spa_routes.HOST }}{{ spa_routes.PATHS['loan'] }}/{{ loan.pid }}>
{% endfor %}

Thank you!
